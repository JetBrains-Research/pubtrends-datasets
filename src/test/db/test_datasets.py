        summary="Dengue virus infection can result in severe symptoms including shock and hemorrhage, but an understanding of the molecular correlates of disease severity is lacking. Bulk transcriptomics on blood samples are difficult to interpret because the blood is composed of different cell types that may react differently to virus infection. Dengue virus RNA can be detected in human plasma, however identifying the cells carrying dengue virus through the bloodstream in vivo has proven challenging. Here we used our recently developed viscRNA-Seq approach to profile transcriptomes of thousands of single blood peripheral mononuclear cells from 6 human subjects with dengue fever and severe dengue, as well as to characterize the cell types associated with dengue virus in the human blood. We found that although no bulk transcriptome marker for severe dengue exists, the expression of MX2 in naive B cells, of CD163 in CD14+/CD16+ monocytes and of other genes in specific cell types is highly predictive for severe dengue. We detected virus-associated cells in the blood of two severe dengue patients with high viral load and discovered the majority of these to be B cells expressing germline IgM or IgD immunoglobulin chains and naive markers but also showing signs of activation and expression of CD69, CXCR4, and other surface receptors. In bystander B cells we detected signs of strong immune activation, parallel hypersomatic evolution and, in one severe degue subject, an anomalously large clone of highly mutated, IgG1 plasmablasts that could be reactive to dengue virus. This study presents a high-resolution molecular exploration into dengue virus infection in humans and can be generalized to any RNA virus.",

How ageing in the absence or presence of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition in different brain areas affects this response and whether sex and AD risk genes are involved, remains however largely unknown. Here we analyzed the gene expression profiles of more than 10,000 individual microglia cells isolated from cortex and hippocampus of male and female AppNL-G-F at 4 different stages of Aβ deposition and in age-matched control mice. We demonstrate that microglia adopt two major activated states during normal aging and after exposure to amyloid plaques. One of the responses (activated response microglia, ARM) is enhanced in particular by amyloid plaques and is strongly enriched with AD risk genes. The ARM response is not homogeneous, as subgroups of microglia overexpressing MHC type II and tissue repair genes (Dkk2, Gpnmb, Spp1) are induced upon prolonged Aβ exposure. Microglia in female mice advance faster in the activation trajectories. Similar activated states were also found in a second AD model and in human brain. We demonstrate that abolishing the expression of Apoe, the major genetic risk factor for AD, impairs the establishment of ARMs, while the second microglia response type, enriched for interferon response genes, remains unaffected.

For data processing, TSO primer, polyA tail, adaptor, and low-quality sequence (N > 10%) were trimmed using Trimmomatic (version 0.36). Clean reads were aligned against the human GRCh38 genome using STAR (version 2.7)). Duplicate reads were identified and removed by using Picard(version 2.17.6). MATS(version 4.0.2) and DaPars(version 0.9.0) to perform alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation analysis, respectively. Gene quantification was using HTSeq (version 0.9.1).",

        summary="Microglia are central players in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology, but analyzing microglia states in human brain samples is challenging due to genetic diversity, postmortem delay and admixture of pathologies. To circumvent these issues, here we generated 138,577 single cell expression profiles of human stem cell-derived microglia xenotransplanted in the brain of the AppNL-G-F model of amyloid pathology and wild type controls. Xenografted human microglia adopt a disease-associated (DAM) profile similar to that seen in mouse microglia, but display a more pronounced HLA state, likely related to antigen presentation in response to amyloid plaques. The human microglial response also involves a pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine CRM response to oligomeric Aβo. Genetic deletion of TREM2 or APOE, as well as APOE polymorphisms and TREM2R47H expression in the transplanted microglia modulate these responses differentially. The expression of other AD risk genes is differentially regulated across the distinct cell states elicited in response to amyloid pathology. Thus, we have identified multiple transcriptomic cell states adopted by human microglia in response to AD-related pathology, which should be taken into account in translational studies.",

Here, we transplanted human microglia progenitors from several stem cell lines (UKBIO11-A, BIONi010-C and H9) into the mouse brain of AppNL-G-F, Apphu/hu or AppNL-G-F ApoE-/-  mice to mimic several amyloid pathology conditions, including injection of oligomeric Aβo.
